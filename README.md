In the field of data compression, Shannonâ€“Fano coding, named after Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, is a technique for
 constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities (estimated or measured). It is 
 suboptimal in the sense that it does not achieve the lowest possible expected code word length like Huffman coding; 
 however it still guarantees that all code word lengths are within one bit of their theoretical ideal i.e. logP(x)
